Setup of Ddlutils 1.0 with Ant tasks in order to migrate from derby db to mysql db.

Requirements:
A complete java runtime environment. This was tested with Java 1.6.0_26

Usage:

1.Edit the database name and location on the build.xml file for target
name database-dump and import-db-to-mysql. The derby db and mysql drivers
are included in the lib directory.

2.Now you can call ant as follows in the current directory.
$> ant database-dump
This will create the db-schema.xml and data.xml files. 

$>ant import-db-to-mysql
This will create the schema on the mysql server and then load the data. 
Note:You have to create the mysql database manually the rest will be taken care
of this by import-db-to-mysql.
